Tools and Libraries Utilized:

Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved several key steps:
Data Cleaning: Examined the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and outliers, and applied appropriate measures to address each.
Visualization: Employed bar charts and stacked charts to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables, providing a clearer understanding of the data.

Conclusion
This EDA provided valuable insights into the distribution of the chosen variables within the dataset, establishing a solid foundation for subsequent exploration and modeling in the data science pipeline.
